## 1. About this repository

For my compilers class, I did 2 projects. The first was done alone and since I would had failled if someone had copied from me, originally, they were created in a private
repository. The first was done alone and it can be found here -->https://github.com/autumn-Days/C-lexical-analyzer<--. The other I did in group and it is not in my repository,
so I moved to here. In this project, I was responsible for parsing source code and constructing a tree structure for representing it, so it can be navigated, the rest, my colleagues
did.
