# Description

I made this project for the "matemática computacional" subject of the Universidade Federal do Ceará in my 5th period. It consists of a simplex solver written with the "Google OR tools" library to solve the K-mis problem, that is, the maximum interserction of k-subsets. The simplex solver was inspired by an ILP model published in an article named "O problema da Máxima Interseção de k-Subconjuntos".
